## Overview

### Summary

> This is a simple landing page with a cool nav-bar animation for the mobile-devices

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

_I learned a lot from this project. Since, this is my first attempt at full responsive website so, it took me a lot of time but it was worth it. I experimented a lot with different componentts and at last I figured a way to make it work._

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

> A new css property that I learned in this project

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  clip-path:circle(100px at 90% -10%)
  -webkit-clip-path:circle(100px at 90% -10%)
}
```

_The above code basically clips the position mentioned above like 90% and -10%
in the shape of a circle. So, its like creating a mask to cover the whole background._

### Continued development

Since, this is my first attempt at full responsive website. So, its not perfect. Thatiswhy I will work on making responsive designs more efficiently.
